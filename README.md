# Hi there, my name is Osas, and welcome to my Profile Page! I am glad you made it this far... 👋


<h2 align="center"><em> I am a DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience in designing, automating, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure using DevOps tools.   </em></h2>

<p>My professional background and experience has centered around developing a culture that improves organizational efficiency through automation, continuous monitoring, testing and maximization of quality. I obtained my education from the TechWorld with Nana DevOps Bootcamp, where I gained deep knowledge in cloud-native tools, container orchestration, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), monitoring, and more.
</p>

<p>
Despite occupying a temporary, contractual position as a Junior DevOps Engineer in my previous job, I contributed to a workplace environment that yielded maximum customer satisfaction and accelerated delivery. 
</p>

<p>Some of my achievements include: reducing manual deployment time by implementing CI/CD pipelines; reduced deployment errors by automating application deployment with tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Helm; and improving issue detection and response times by integraring monitoring & logging tools like Prometheus, Grafana.</p>
